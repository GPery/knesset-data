## Data Contributions

An important part of Knesset-Aata project is to document and test the actual Knesset Data.

We have documentation of the available Knesset APIs and Data.

You can help to:

* **improve the existing documentation**
* **test and document missing details**
* **[issues on our issue tracker](https://github.com/hasadna/knesset-data/issues)**


## Code Contributions

You can either extend the existing interfaces or write new interfaces.

JS is pretty cool now, why not write an interface for it?
