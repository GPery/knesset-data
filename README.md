# knesset-dataservice
APIs and documentation to allow easier working with the official Knesset data-service APIs

The goal of this project is to ease the use of the [official Knesset APIs](http://online.knesset.gov.il/WsinternetSps/KnessetDataService/) for technical users.

The Knesset APIs use a slightly non-standard and incomplete [OData protocol](http://www.odata.org/).

Project Goals:

* document the APIs
* track [bugs and problems](https://github.com/hasadna/knesset-dataservice/issues)
* provide easy to use APIs in Python (possibly other language as well)
