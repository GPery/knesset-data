# knesset-data
APIs and documentation to allow getting data from the Israeli Parliament (Knesset).

The preferred source of the data are the [official Knesset APIs](http://online.knesset.gov.il/WsinternetSps/KnessetDataService/) - however, not all data is available from them so we might also provide APIs that scrape the Knesset website.

Project Goals:

* document the available data
* track [bugs and problems](https://github.com/hasadna/knesset-dataservice/issues)
* provide easy to use APIs in Python (possibly other languages as well)
